Scaffold(
    floatingActionButton: ExpandableFab(
    distance: 100,
    openIcon: Icon(Icons.add),
    closeIcon: Icon(Icons.close),
    children: [
        ActionButton(
        child: Text("Child 1"),
        onPressed: () {},
        ),
        ActionButton(
        child: Text("Child 2"),
        onPressed: () {},
        ),
     ],
),)
